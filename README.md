## Curated Notes Regarding Property Investing in Australia

In the year 2017, with almost zero knowledge on how to invest in the stock market, I was able to learn, navigate and invest in Australia Stock Market (ASX). Not bad for self leaner. 

This year, I decided to learn how the Australia's Property Market works. This repo will served as a curated list of information, jargons, etc that I can used in the future, if ever that I decided to buy my own property or maybe join the real estate game.

For those who are also based in AU, feel free to contribute. 😁

## Curated Notes Regarding Property Investing in Australia

In the year 2017, with almost zero knowledge on how to invest in the stock market, I was able to learn, navigate and invest in Australia Stock Market (ASX). Not bad for self leaner. 

This year, I decided to learn how the Australia's Property Market works. This repo will served as my notes, where in I can dump information, links, articles, jargons, that I learn along the way. Maybe in the future, If ever I decided to buy my own property or join the real estate game, then this wiki will serve as my reference. üòÅ

For those who are also based in AU, feel free to contribute.

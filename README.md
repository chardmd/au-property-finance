## Curated Notes Regarding Property Investing in Australia

In the year 2017, with almost zero knowledge on how to invest in the stock market, I was able to learn, navigate and invest in Australia Stock Market (ASX). Not bad for self leaner.

This year, I decided to learn how the Australia's Property Market works. This repo will served as my notes, where in I can dump information, links, articles, jargons, that I learn along the way. Maybe in the future, If ever that I decided to buy my own property or join the real estate game, then this wiki will serve as my guidance. üòÅ

For those who are also based in AU, feel free to contribute.

* **Loan Amortization** - The process of making making loan repayments and can be depicted in loan amortization schedule, which is basically a table that depicting all loan repayments over pre-determined time frame.

* **Investment Property** - Any property secured or purchased by a person, that generates capital growth or appreciation over time. They are either leased out to tenants.
* **Negatively Geared Growth Properties** - Properties that are closed to CBD areas of Autralia. These are town houses, apartments, detached houses. They have a consistent capital growth of 10% and rental return of 4.5%. Historically, these type of investments doubled every 7 to 10 years since 1901.
* **Cash Flow Positive Properties** - These are located away from the CBD of Australia. They usually found in regional centres or mining towns such as Gladstone in QLD or Portland in Western Australia. These properties are also consists of detached town houses, apartments, etc.
* **Primary Place of Residence** - Property that is main purpose of the buyer is to occupy the property. Having said that, some investors will often buy these properties and eventually turning them away into investments into the future.

## Two Categories of Mortgages

* **Principle and Interest (P & I) Loans** - The most common way to repay a mortgage.
* **Interest Only (IO) Loans** - Are popular with property investors, wherey only the interest component of the loan remains unchanged during the life of the loan. You can build significant wealth faster and to a large extent more safely by utilizing IO than widely accepted P&I.

In the introduction of the 'National Credit Consumer Protection Legislation (NCCP)', most interest only loans are set for 5 to 10 years then revert back to Principle and Interest (P & I) loan.
